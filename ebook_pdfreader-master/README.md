## :rocket: Quick start

### Step 1: Clone the repo
Fork the repository. then clone the repo locally

### Step 2: Change package name.
Change package name to something unique. Firebase requires this.

### Step 3: Download google-services.json file
This projects uses firebase. So we need to download `google-services.json` file.
You can go through this: https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup

### Step 4: Using google services file.
Now, you need to add `google-services.json` given by firebase to app directory.

### Step 5: To add books
If you want to add books you can directly add it to your firebase's realtime database by creating `documents` (you can give your custom name but you will have to change the path reference in the `MainActivity.java` file to exactly match your directory name) directory by adding file title in `filename` and link to your pdf in `fileurl` (you can give your custom name here also but you will have to make changes in `myAdapter.java` , `Book.java` , `item.java` file according to what you named them).

### Step 6: This is it.
After this all, all thats left is to run the app
